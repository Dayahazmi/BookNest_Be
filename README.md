# Project Setup

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Step 1: Start PostgreSQL with Docker

1. Start the PostgreSQL container by running:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Open your `.env` file (created by Prisma) and set the `DATABASE_URL` for your PostgreSQL database:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/book_nest"
   ```

3. Run the Prisma migration to apply your existing schema to the PostgreSQL database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

4. Generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

5. Start the API server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
